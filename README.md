Little experiment using File Manipulation Functions and Search Algorithms and Grep.


## Objectives
1. from the cli/Terminal create with minimal arguments a folder and text file with the name the user wants
2. Make a search option to search for text inside files. 
3. Make the program as flexible as possible with the User Experience, I.E: Having a argument based use, Synchronous Text Based solution and Future-ly a GUI. 

### Starting Plans

1. Make a arg separator and write the args on a print


#### Setup for developing in other machines:
Do on your terminal inside the repo: 
`python -m venv env`
